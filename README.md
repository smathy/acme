# Acme

There's not enough silliness in the Ruby community.  I aim to misbehave.

This is just a namespace where you can add your gems of mischief, feel free to
add your own Acme::* gems, if you want them included in the base _Acme_ gem then
just raise a pull request in this repo and I'll add it in.

## Current Gems

 * [Acme::Bleach](//github.com/smathy/acme-bleach)
 * [Acme::Heisenberg](//github.com/smathy/acme-heisenberg)
 * [Acme::Leeway](//github.com/rthbound/acme-leeway)
 * [Acme::Umlautify](//github.com/amz4f/acme-umlautify)
